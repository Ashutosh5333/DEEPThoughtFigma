Your thinking starts when you start thinking beyond your thinking.</p>, <p>Let's prepare Sandwiches, we will use Pareto&rsquo;s Law. That&rsquo;s an 80-20 approach.<br>80% of the time in researching, and planning and 20% of the time in implementation.</p>,<p>So for preparing sandwiches, we need vegetables, bread, cheese, butter and much more. So initially we collect all the stuff and then chop the vegetables, grate the cheese, and make a mash of potato. So this all comes in 80% and then comes 20% where we will roast the bread, spread the sauce, place the mash put some cheese, and heat it for a while and our sandwich is ready.</p>,<p>Similarly while creating any functionality 80% of the time is spent on consequences that might appear, some parameters we have to take care of, the scope of the variable, and some dependent functions, and then 20% comes from implementation.</p>,<p>Let's start thinking together, and search for how you can get the essence of project management.</p>",
